        <p>Midterm Reflection</p>

        <div class="text">
            <p>The first half of this course was very challenging for me, I was not expecting the entire class to be focused on coding. I was having a hard time figuring it out and understanding, I think that what I found the most challenging was actually understanding the building blocks of coding. In general, I am an anxious person and I get overwhelmed easily so having my entire code break because of a missing semicolon was very frustrating. One thing that surprised me is how coding is literally another language, that needs to be learned and understood. I found this very difficult partially because I didn’t have to learn anything new from scratch in a very long time, so I was very hard on myself. Another thing that surprised me is how I found myself starting to learn the languages and making more sense of the punctuation and formatting, I started finding patterns and getting more comfortable with it. For my next project, I would definitely try to push myself more and not be shy to ask for help. My project 1 is quite basic and straight forward, for the next one, I would like to incorporate more complex features and really bring my vision to my project. The biggest barrier blocking me from achieving my goals in this course is the fact that I get overwhelmed by new things. I am also not used to not being good at something so I’ve noticed myself slipping into this vicious cycle. Where I start working, then an error occurs, I spend an unreasonably long time trying to figure out what’s wrong then I just cry and close my laptop for a few days. This is not a sustainable working cycle and is no way to approach a project. I think that once I get over this anxiety and just chill out and approach this project one step at a time, I will be able to achieve what I want.

 <p>API Research</p>

  <p> The library I would like to explore for phase 2 is Three.js. Three.js is a 3D graphics library that allows you to get 3-dimensional content onto a webpage. Three.js is often confused with WebGL as Three.js uses WebGL to draw 3D objects. Three.js handles components such as; scenes, lights, shadows, materials, textures, 3d math, all things that you'd have to write yourself if you were to use WebGL directly. There are many aspects to consider when using this library, it’s like creating an entire three-dimensional world. You must take into account the scene, camera, textures, etc. For my future project, I would like to incorporate some three-dimensional elements using three.js and create an 8-bit world that changes with the beat of the music. Creating a 3D music visualizer in an 8-bit aesthetic. One technical limitation that I can think of, is the speed of my computer as I have struggled in the past with large, complex software.
