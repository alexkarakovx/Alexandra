            <p>8-Bit is an aesthetic inspired by old school videogames. It consists of simple pixel drawings often with very bright, vibrant colors. Technically, when referring to videogames, 8-Bit just means that the game is made up of 256 places to store information. Games like Super Mario, flappy bird and packman are all examples of 8-Bit games. However an 8-Bit aesthetic is inspired by the games but is totally different. The color palette is very unique as the colors mostly used are; purple, pink and blue. I chose this aesthetic because the dominant colors happen to be my favorite colors and the colors that I use the most. My personal aesthetic is kind of similar, I like vibrant contrasting colors. The simplicity of the aesthetic also attracted my attention to it because I like how it’s simple yet doesn’t lack anything, like it’s not complex but you understand immediately what’s going on. In my research I have also found that the 8-Bit aesthetic is kind of similar to the vaporwave aesthetic. Vaporwave uses similar colors and has this digital electronic vibe to it. It is more complex and not restrained by the number of pixels, it is used a lot in relation to electronic music. 8-Bit aesthetic is different because the images are a lot less complex and are made up of less pixels.

     A Music Visualizer is a software that generates animations from music. The first electronic music visualizer was invented in 1976 and it was the Atari Music and it was a machine that visually represented music in simple colored 8 bit pixels. It was pioneered by Rober Brown in the US and by Fred Judd in the UK. Music visualizers were popular among deaf people as well to help them see music. Today, music visualizers are very common and a lot more accessable, major music streaming platforms such as; iTunes and Spotify embedded them into their software to elevate the user experience. Music visualizers are also available online for free. The best and most popular music visualizers are; VSDC Video Editor Free – Audio Spectrum Visualizer, After Effects – The Audio Spectrum Effect, Winamp, and Media Monkey. Music visualizers are extremely popular and accessible. Not only can you open a free visualizer in your browzer, but you can also make your own quite easily using Adobe Aftereffects. The main purpose of a music visualizer is to enhance the users experience by providing a visual representation of the music. An enabling technology is some sort of innovation that drives design and development, music visualizers are not that complex. Therefore the technology required to make one is quite widely available. I chose this emergent media because I personally find it really cool and since I started researching it I’ve been using music visualizers a lot! In my research I have also noticed that quite often music visualizers are used to visualize electronic/ techno music. This is another reason why I chose this media. I think that it will go well with my chosen 8-bit aesthetic. The reason for this is that 8-bit aesthetic focuses a lot on digital art and bright colors. I also think it could be interesting to combine the two and create a music visualizer that creates 8-bit pixel drawings, using the chosen color palette according to the music.

<h3>My 8-Bit Music Visualizer</h3>

For Project 1, I have decided to combine the 8-bit aesthetic with the music visualizer technology. Originally, “8-bit is an early computer hardware device or software program that is capable of transferring eight bits of data at the same time.” The aesthetic is inspired by old school videogames. It consists of simple pixel drawings often with very bright, vibrant colors. The colors are what attracted me the most to this aesthetic. The color palette is very unique as the colors mostly used are; purple, pink, and blue. I chose this aesthetic because the dominant colors happen to be my favorite colors and the colors that I use the most. My personal aesthetic is kind of similar, I like vibrant contrasting colors. The simplicity of the aesthetic also attracted my attention to it because I like how it’s simple yet makes sense. My chosen media is Music Visualizers, the first-ever music visualizer was done by Atari Music in 1976 and it produced simple colored 8-bit pixels. I chose this media because I love music and I use music visualizers quite often. My JBL speaker changes colors with the music and I use “kaleidosync” as an online visualizer for Spotify. I find them highly functional as their main purpose is to generate animations that represent sounds. In my opinion, it is more enjoyable to listen to music and be able to see it at the same time, it really provides a more rounded experience. I really liked how both, the aesthetic and the media originally started in 8-bit, ideally, I would’ve liked to pay a tribute to that in my project. In my project, I wanted to represent music in the style of the 8-bit aesthetic and while I feel that my final music visualizer does the job, it’s not exactly how I would’ve wanted it to be. Due to the fact that my coding skills are quite basic, what I was able to achieve is limited. Although it might not look like much to people familiar with coding, I am amazed at what I have been able to achieve. I have created a functioning music visualizer in my chosen aesthetic. My journey consisted of errors and tears but I can confidently say that I am proud of my work! Throughout the process of working on this project, I have explored many different aspects of coding. I’ve learned to build a website, software clocks, webcam filters, generative poetry, and music visualizers, all in my chosen 8-bit aesthetic. The process was tough and caused me a lot of frustration and anxiety, but in the end, it was all worth it as I am able to look back at my work and reflect. For my next project, I would definitely try to push myself more and not get as overwhelmed. I would like to create a genuine representation of my vision. Not only has this project put me through a lot with deadlines, but It has also allowed me to better deal with my anxiety and learn how to translate my thoughts into code to develop a music visualizer. My process with this project also allowed me to progress deeper into my own thoughts and ask myself, what is it that I visualize to match up with my coding and vise versa, where are the limitations of both my possibilities with code and my visualizations for this project as a whole.
